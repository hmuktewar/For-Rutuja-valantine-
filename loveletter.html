<h2>My Dearest Rutuja ❤️</h2>

<p>
From the day you came into my life, everything became more beautiful.
Your smile is my peace, your voice is my favorite sound,
and your love is my biggest strength.
</p>

<p>
I promise to stand by you, support you,
annoy you, love you, and protect you forever.
You are not just my girlfriend…
you are my everything. 💖
</p>

<p>
Forever yours,<br>
Himanshu ❤️
